    <p>
UFC 249 is one the most anticipated sporting event in some time. Due to Covid-19 the sports world as a whole has mostly been put on hold. UFC it's self has cancled or postponed multiple events including this one. Previously scheduled for April 18th at the Barclay's Center in Brooklyn, New York the event was pushed back nearly a month to Saturday, May 9th and moved to a new location in VyStar Veterans Memorial Areana in Jacksonville, Florida. This coming after Florida had deemed sports essential.</p> 
<p>With many of it's roster and previously booked competitors residing over seas, this card has undergone many changes due to an active travel ban. Despite all this, this line up is still very impresive. We at INF250 News are very excited for this night as it is the unofficial start of a return to norm in the world of U.S. proffesional sports. The Pre-lims will start at at 7PM CDT on ESPN with the main-card starting at 9PM CDT and available for purchase on ESPN+.
