          <H3>Gella's Diner & LB Brewing Reopening!</H3>   
          <p>Beers, food, and laughs. That's what was missing from downtown Hays when Gella's Diner & LB was forced to close its doors due to the growing Covid-19 pandemic on March 17th. They weren't alone in closing as virtually the entire resturant industry fell victim to no customers leaving many furrloughed and forced to deal with the crippling process of unemployment claims. Despite these tough times as many buisness owners were forced to shut down permanetly, Gella's would eventually see the light of the day as Govoner Laura Kelly called for an end to her Stay at Home order.</p> 
          <p>With the support of local investors Gella's is now announcing it's Grand Reopening while still following the new social distancing guide lines scheduled for Wednesday, May 13th. About a week ago Brewers were given a notice and immediatly got back to work in order to give the People of Hays the freshes Beer imaginable but even with the short notice Brew Master Brendan Arnold claims the selection of Beer will be limited but as more restrictions are lifted, more beers should come too. With the new social distancing rules in place, not everyone can come in as 50 people is still capaticity until further notice, so if you're wanting to come in and have great beer, food, and fun call and make reservations immediately but parties of more than 10 may be out of luck! </p>
